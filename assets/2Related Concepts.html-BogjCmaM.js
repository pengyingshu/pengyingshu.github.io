This process organizes these entities into a structured hierarchy of taxonomic ranks, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding and study of biodiversit. The internationally accepted taxonomic nomenclature is the Linnaean system, created by Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup>. The system is based on the idea that organisms can be grouped into smaller and smaller groups based on their shared characteristics. The modern taxonomic classification system has eight main levels<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref2"></a></sup>:</p>',3),C=e("img",{src:d,alt:"modern taxonomic classification system except domain",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"},null,-1),T={href:"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/288652657337869051",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=a('<ol><li>Domain: All living organisms are categorized into three fundamental domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The plant kingdom falls within the Eukarya domain, distinguished by their eukaryotic cells with a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.</li><li>Kingdom: Plantae(plants), comprising the vast kingdom of plants, encompasses over 280,000 diverse species. This kingdom encompasses everything from towering Redwoods to delicate mosses, showcasing the remarkable variety of plant life.</li><li>Phylum: Within Plantae, we find the Angiospermae(flowering plants), boasting over 250,000 species. This vibrant phylum is recognized for its characteristic reproductive structure – the flower – which has revolutionized terrestrial ecosystems.</li><li>Class: Roses belong to the class Dicotyledonae (dicots), characterized by seeds containing two embryonic leaves. However, not all flowering plants follow this blueprint. Orchids, for example, belong to the class Monocotyledonae (monocots), bearing seeds with only one embryonic leaf.</li><li>Order: Plants with similar structures and evolutionary relationships are grouped into orders. Order Rosales encompasses roses and their close relatives, sharing specific floral and leaf characteristics. In contrast, Orchidaceae embraces a diverse group of plants, including the mesmerizing orchid family.</li><li>Family: Families represent groups of genera sharing more specific physical and behavioral characteristics than those at higher taxonomic ranks. The Rosaceae family (rose family) encompasses various rose species with similar floral structures and growth patterns. Similarly, orchids belong to the Orchidaceae family, one of the largest families in the plant kingdom.</li><li>Genus: Genera represent groups of closely related species that share a recent common ancestor. Rosa, for example, houses all true roses, while the genus Cymbidium encompasses the elegant Chinese Cymbidium orchids.</li><li>Species: The most specific taxonomic unit is the species. A species represents a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. Rosa gallica, the moss rose, exemplifies this concept within the rose family. Likewise, Cymbidium goeringii, a species of Chinese Cymbidium orchid, represents a distinct lineage within its genus.</li></ol><p>The eight established ranks of the biological classification system serve as the foundation for taxonomic hierarchy, and are widely used for organizing and categorizing organisms. Nonetheless, in certain groups, supplementary subordinate ranks may be employed to provide a more detailed understanding of the relationships between organisms. For those interested in delving deeper into these ranks and their practical application, I suggest referring to professional texts on plant taxonomy,for example， <em><strong>International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</strong></em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref3"></a></sup>.</p><p><strong>variant and cultivar</strong></p><p>In addition to the eight fundamental levels, the Orchid2024 dataset we offer also includes more nuanced levels than the species level, such as variety and cultivars. A variety is a further classification within a species, representing individuals with naturally occurring unique characteristics. These varieties within a species arise from factors such as geographical isolation, mutations, or adaptation to specific environments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref4"></a></sup>. They may exhibit subtle differences in appearance, growth habit, or ecological preferences compared to the “typical” species. However, these differences are often less pronounced than those between distinct species. Essentially, a variety can be thought of as a subgroup within a species, possessing unique traits, yet still capable of interbreeding with other members of the same species.</p><p>Cultivars are cultivated of plants that have been selected for specific desirable traits, such as larger fruit, different flower colors, or resistance to disease. Cultivars are not naturally occurring but are created and maintained by humans through selective breeding or other techniques. For example, there are hundreds of apple cultivars, each with its own unique characteristics<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote5">[5]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref5"></a></sup>. In order to maintain the plant’s new feature, the cultivar can only be cloned by taking cuttings, grafting, or tissue culture. Attempts to grow identical plants from the seeds of a cultivar usually result in a plant that reverts to either one of the parents or something completely different than intended.</p>',5),O=e("img",{src:f,alt:"variety vs cultivar",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"},null,-1),S={href:"https://siamteas.com/tea-abc-tea-school/tea-cultivar-tea-plant-variety/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},q=a('<p>All cultivars belong to a specific species or its variety. They can be derived from a single species or be interspecific hybrids. So, you can regard as cultivar is a more fine-grained unit than speice and variety So, to recap: <code>Species &gt; Variety &gt; Cultivar</code>. Each level represents a narrower range of genetic diversity and more specific characteristics. Cultivars are the most specific and human-influenced unit, making them the &quot;finest-grained&quot; in this streamline.</p><p>Here, the term &quot;cultivar&quot; is typically used in the context of plants, specifically cultivars. So, strictly speaking, no, cultivars do not exist in the same way for animals. However, there are some concepts related to animal breeding that share some similarities with cultivars. Breeds: Like cultivars, breeds are distinct populations of animals within a species that share specific physical or behavioral characteristics. They are created and maintained through selective breeding, where animals with desired traits are mated to produce offspring with those same traits. Examples include dog breeds like Labrador Retriever or Poodle, or cattle breeds like Holstein or Angus.</p><p>The Orchid2024 dataset is a comprehensive collection of Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchid images. It encompasses over 1,200 cultivars across 8 species and their variants. However, given the widespread cultivation of Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids, there may be additional cultivars and numerous hybrids not yet included in the dataset. I am actively seeking to expand the dataset to include these cultivars.</p><p><strong>Naming Plant Species, Varieties, and Cultivars</strong></p><p>The rules for naming plant species, varieties, and cultivars are guided by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote6">[6]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref6"></a></sup>. Botanical nomenclature is the body of rules for determining which name applies to a particular taxon, and occasionally if a new name is needed. Modern botanical nomenclature started with Carl Linnaeus and his 1753 publication, Species Plantarum (Latin for &quot;The Species of Plants&quot;). It is now governed by the ICNCP. This code provides regulations for naming cultigens, plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. Let&#39;s delve into the world of plant names refer to the picture below:</p><ol><li><p>Species: Each species has a unique scientific name consisting of two parts(Latin Binomial), the genus (first, capitalized) and the specific epithet (second, lowercase), representing the basic unit of scientific classification. (Example: Cymbidium goeringii is the species name, &quot;Cymbidium &quot; is the genus and &quot;goeringii &quot; is the specific epithet.) Regardless of language or region, this scientific name identifies the species precisely. In the horticulture industry, Cymbidium often omitted as C. or Cym.</p></li><li><p>Varieties(Infraspecific Rank and Name): Sometimes there may be variants in certain species. So, varieties are denoted by the species name followed by &quot;var.&quot; and the variety name, in italics. For example, Cymbidium goeringii var. longibracteatum can be used to denote a variety(variant specie) of Cymbidium goeringii.</p></li><li><p>Cultivar: Each cultivar possesses a unique epithet that is distinct from the species and variety names. However, not all plants have a cultivar name. This depends on whether there exists a collection of plants that have been selected and cultivated for their particular, distinct, uniform, and stable attributes. These names are enclosed in single quotation marks. At times, cultivar names are registered with international or director authorities and must adhere to specific rules regarding length, format, and uniqueness, so that the name becomes officially recognized and protected, ensuring no other cultivar can be named the same. If a cultivar is not registered, it is typically named according to the customs of the plant industry. For instance, many cultivar of Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids are not registered. In such cases, I opt for a common rule: using the Pinyin of these flowers’ Chinese names as their cultivar names.</p></li><li><p>Common Name and the Trademark Name: Common names are informal names used by the general public. Occasionally, nurseries develop and trademark cultivar names to make them more marketable<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote7">[7]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref7"></a></sup>. These names can often be omitted.</p></li></ol>',6),A=e("img",{src:p,alt:"plant nomenclature",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"},null,-1),R={href:"https://bcarboretum.org/plants/nomenclature",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},I=a('<p><strong>Some questions about flower names</strong></p><p>Reading this, you may be confused. When we discuss various flowers, are we referring to a vibrant tapestry of species, a specific genus, or perhaps an entire floral family? If an individual casually mentions their appreciation for the beauty of various flowers, they might be using the term in a broad sense to include all types, encompassing different species, genera, and families.</p><p>The level of detail we’re addressing can fluctuate based on the context and the aspect we wish to highlight. For instance, if we’re discussing the unique features of a specific flower, like the climbing habit of clematis, the species is most relevant. If we’re comparing the petal structure of different lilies, the genus might be a more suitable level. And if we’re discussing the fruit development of plants with fleshy fruits, the family could be the appropriate level. To circumvent confusion, it’s always beneficial to provide additional information or clarify the level of detail when discussing flowers. For eample, The terminology we use for phalaenopsis, roses, and orchids depends on the context and the level of detail we wish to communicate:</p><ul><li><p>Phalaenopsis:</p><ul><li>Genus: This is the most precise term because “phalaenopsis” refers to a specific genus of flowering plants within the larger orchid family.</li><li>Species: There are about 70 species within the Phalaenopsis genus, so using the term “phalaenopsis” could technically refer to any of these individual species, but without further clarification, it would be ambiguous.</li><li>Family: Saying “phalaenopsis” is not accurate at the family level. Phalaenopsis belongs to the Orchidaceae family, so if you want to emphasize the broader group, Orchidaceae family,would be the appropriate term.</li></ul></li><li><p>Roses:</p><ul><li>Genus: “Rose” can denote the genus Rosa, which encompasses hundreds of species with diverse characteristics.</li><li>Species: Specifying a particular rose species like Rosa chinensis (China rose) or Rosa damascena (Damask rose) provides more accurate information.</li><li>Family: Roses belong to the Rosaceae family, but simply saying “rose” wouldn’t imply this level of classification.</li></ul></li><li><p>Orchids:</p><ul><li>Family: “Orchid” refers to the entire Orchidaceae family, one of the largest and most diverse plant families, containing over 880 genera and 26,000 species.</li><li>Genus: Saying “orchid” doesn’t specify a specific genus within the family. Phalaenopsis, Cattleya, Dendrobium, and Cymbidium are just a few of the numerous orchid genera.</li><li>Species: As with roses, mentioning a specific orchid species like Phalaenopsis amabilis or Cattleya walkeriana is the most precise way to identify the plant.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In conclusion, the appropriate term depends on the context and the level of specificity required. If the information source isn’t explicitly referring to a particular species or family, attributing it to a genus is less prone to error. When there’s ambiguity, it’s indeed safest to assume the term refers to the genus, as it’s a middle ground between the broadness of a family and the specificity of a species.</p><h2 id="_2-2-relevant-concepts-of-orchid-names" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-relevant-concepts-of-orchid-names"><span>2.2 Relevant concepts of orchid names</span></a></h2><p>Orchids, scientifically known as Orchidaceae, encompass all plants within the orchid family.

Its purpose, whether purely aesthetic, medicinal, or a beautiful blend of both, is equally unclear. The earliest documented mention can be traced back to the mythical Chinese ruler Shennong, whose &quot;Divine Farmer&#39;s Herb-Root Classic&quot; extolled the medicinal virtues of Dendrobium orchids<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote15">[15]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref15"></a></sup>.

The term is derived from the Greek word “orchis” ,which translates to “testicle.” This association was made due to the resemblance of the root tubers of certain orchid species, particularly those in the Orchis genus, to a pair of testicles. In his work “Inquiry into Plants” written around 300 BC, Theophrastus, a student of Aristotle, used the term “orkhis” to refer to some terrestrial species of orchids which gave origin to the name of the whole family &quot;Orchidaceae&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote16">[16]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref16"></a></sup>.
