Botanically, it includes five species of the genus Cymbidium: Cymbidium goeringii, C. faberi, C. ensifolium, C. sinense, C. kanran, and three varieties of Cymbidium goeringii, namely, C. goeringii var. longibracteatum, C. goeringii var. tortisepalum, and C.goeringii var.serratum. Among these, Cymbidium goeringii is the most renowned and is prominently featured in the Orchid2024 dataset, which was created by the author and contains a significant number of images of this species.</p><p>In Chinese, the term for Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> Orchids is often &quot;Lan&quot; or &quot;Guo Lan.&quot; Consequently, the word &quot;orchid,&quot; whether used in Chinese or English, typically refers to Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> Orchids within China. As a result, in many contexts, including oral communication, written text, plant technology, and even academic translations from Chinese to English, the Chinese term for Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> Orchids is often literally translated based on its pinyin to &quot;Chinese orchid.&quot; Similarly, the Chinese term for Cymbidium goeringii is often literally translated based on its pinyin to &quot;spring orchid.&quot;</p><p>In fact, I don’t believe there’s anything wrong with this. When I attended the second Spring Orchid exhibition to gather images for my orchid dataset, I noticed that the botanical term ‘Cymbidium goeringii’ was translated as ‘Spring Orchid’ not only in the exhibition but also in various news reports. Although, in a broader scientific context, it’s more accurate to use ‘Cymbidium goeringii’ to ensure precise identification and avoid confusion. However, I think it’s beneficial that the organizers used ‘Spring Orchid’ as a simplified or descriptive term for a wider audience who might not be familiar with the scientific name.</p><figure><img src="'+d+'" alt="Spring orchid exhibition, captured by the author during a data collection expedition (2023, Shaoxing, China)" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Spring orchid exhibition, captured by the author during a data collection expedition (2023, Shaoxing, China)</figcaption></figure><p>Cymbidium orchids, native to China, are esteemed symbols of strength, resilience, and nobility in Chinese culture. This reverence has spurred dedicated cultivation efforts, leading to the development of superior cultivars with sought-after traits, thereby promoting cultivar diversification. The cultivation of Cymbidium in China has a rich history, tracing back to at least the Song Dynasty (960-1279). The significance of this traditional &quot;orchid culture&quot; extends beyond China’s borders, influencing other countries historically touched by Han Chinese culture, such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, where Cymbidium is also held in high regard today<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup>.</p><p>I’d like to discuss the orchid2024 dataset that I’ve created.

This discrepancy arises because these species are not widely known outside of orchid growers or merchants, and they have not generated a mature cultivar system. Furthermore, the placement of some species within the Cymbidium genus remains huge debated among botanists, adding complexity to their inclusion in the category of &quot;Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref2"></a></sup> .</p><p>Given this issue, we prioritize both professionalism and usability in the dataset: In Orchid2024, I have included images of four species: Cymbidium cyperifolium var. szechuanicum, Cymbidium floribundum, Cymbidium hybrid, and Cymbidium lancifolium.

In China, they are often referred to as &quot;Lan&quot; (兰) or &quot;Guo Lan&quot; (国兰). This enduring appreciation is reflected in their presence throughout Chinese history, appearing in texts as early as the &quot;Classic of Poetry(诗经)&quot;, a collection of poems dating back to the 11th to 6th centuries BC<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote8">[8]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref8"></a></sup>.</p><p>Yet, it was Confucius (551 B.C.- 479 B.C.), the great thinker and educator, who truly intertwined the orchid with the Chinese culture<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote9">[9]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref9"></a></sup>. His travels throughout China saw him promoting his ideas of ethics and virtue as the ideal form of governance.Despite facing setbacks, his spirit remained unwavering. Legend speaks of a day when Confucius was journeying from Wei (卫, an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou Dynasty) back to Lu (鲁, an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou Dynasty). As he traversed a valley, he stumbled upon a sight of &#39;Lan&#39; in full bloom. The valley was filled with their intoxicating fragrance. Yet, these beautiful flowers were surrounded by weeds. Overwhelmed by the scene, Confucius couldn’t help but express his emotions with a sigh:</p><div class="language- line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="" data-title="" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>夫兰当为王者香,</span></span>

While his talk about &#39;Lan&#39; described its fragrant nature, Confucius didn&#39;t mention its appearance. For more than a thousand years after that, the term &quot;lan&quot; was widely used in Chinese literature to refer to aromatic plants, rather than being specifically associated with orchids<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote9">[9:1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref9:1"></a></sup>.

However, the lack of absolute conclusive evidence fuels a counter-argument, with many others proposing that ancient &#39;Lan&#39; and modern orchids belong to the same species. This confusion stems from varying descriptions of orchids over time, resulting in the classification of &quot;ancient Lan&quot; and &quot;modern Lan&quot;. The Chinese botanical community refers to the &quot;Lan&quot; from the Spring and Autumn Period(770-476 BCE) to the late Tang Dynasty(618-907 CE) as &quot;ancient Lan&quot;, and the &quot;Lan&quot; after the Tang Dynasty are called &quot;modern Lan&quot;, which is what we now call Chinese Cymbidium orchids.</p><p>This debate about &#39;Lan&#39;, fueled by the immense ornamental and economic value of Chinese Cymbidium orchids, has persisted in China for nearly a thousand years since the late Tang Dynasty(618-907 CE), but it has not yet been completed.</p><h3 id="_3-3-2-current-status-of-relevant-disputes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-2-current-status-of-relevant-disputes"><span>3.3.2 Current status of relevant disputes</span></a></h3><p><strong>Differences in Lan is equivalent to Chinese Cymbidium Orchids</strong></p><p>In the late twentieth century, several famous Chinese botanists conducted extensive research on the identification of ancient and modern orchid species.

In Chinese culture, they symbolize virtues like integrity, modesty, and nobility. Confucius himself revered them as the &quot;Gentleman of Noble Virtue&quot; and the &quot;King of Fragrance.&quot; However, their very allure has fueled a dark side. Price speculation and rapid overcollection, driven by their rarity, beauty, fragrance, and perceived pharmaceutical potential, have pushed many species to the brink of extinction<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote16">[16]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref16"></a></sup>. Habitat loss further exacerbates this threat. While China boasts a thousands-year-old tradition of Cymbidium cultivation, harnessing these orchids for their full potential remains surprisingly underdeveloped. This disconnect between cultural reverence and sustainable utilization creates a precarious situation for these treasured plants.</p><p>In order to collect and preserve orchid plants represented by Orchids Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids, China has established 6 national ornamental plants germplasm resource centerfor genus Cymbidium. The following is a summary of these resource centers:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Province</th><th>Germplasm resource center</th><th>Genus (Cymbidium)</th><th>species or cultivars number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>福建<br>Fujian</td><td>福建省连城县连城兰花股份有限公司家国兰种质资源库<br>National Cymbidium Germplasm Resource Center of Fujian Liancheng Orchid Co., Ltd.</td><td>兰属<br>Cymbidium</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>广东<br>Guangdong</td><td>广东省汕头市澄海区广东远东国兰股份兰属有限公司国家国兰种质资源库<br>National Cymbidium Germplasm Resource Center of Guangdong Yuandong Guolan Co., Ltd.</td><td>兰属<br>Cymbidium</td><td>1380</td></tr><tr><td>广东<br>Guangdong</td><td>广东省广州市白云区广东省农业科学院国家蝴蝶兰、墨兰种质资源库<br>National Phalaenopsis and Cymbidium sinense Germplasm Resource Center of Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences</td><td>蝴蝶兰属、兰属等<br>Phalaenopsis, Cymbidium</td><td>1264</td></tr><tr><td>云南<br>Yunan</td><td>云南省昆明市盘龙区云南野生兰收藏基地有限公司国家兰属种质资源库<br>National Cymbidium Germplasm Resource Center of Yunnan Wild Orchid Collection Base Co., Ltd</td><td>兰属<br>Cymbidium</td><td>580</td></tr><tr><td>江苏<br>Jiangsu</td><td>江苏省扬州市农业科学研究院国家春兰属、蕙兰种质资源库<br>National Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium faberi Germplasm Resource Center of Jiangsu Lixiahe District Institute of Agricultural Sciences</td><td>春兰、蕙兰<br>Cymbidium</td><td>622</td></tr><tr><td>湖南<br>Hunan</td><td>湖南省园艺研究所国家蕙兰种质资源库<br>National Cymbidium faberi Germplasm Cymbidium Resource Center of Hunan Horticultural Research Institute</td><td>兰属<br>Cymbidium</td><td>1000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite China&#39;s centuries-long tradition of Cymbidium cultivation, the exact number of cultivated varieties remains shrouded in mystery. Numerous cultivars thrive across the country, but many lack formal documentation or clear classification. This ambiguity, further amplified by regional cultivation practices and potential name duplications, makes comprehensive resource collection and protection a formidable challenge. Precise estimates vary, with some sources citing figures between 1,000 and 3,000 cultivars<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote17">[17]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref17"></a></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, determining the appearance of these orchids and accurately identifying individual cultivars are essential steps in preserving this rich botanical heritage. Some examples of why this is important:</p><ul><li><p>Preventing Illegal Trade: Recognizing the appearance of these orchids and distinguishing them from similar cultivars simplifies the process of identifying and halting illegal trade. This is also vital for the protection of endangered cultivars.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring Populations: The accurate identification and tracking of individual cultivars enable researchers to monitor orchid populations over time, evaluate their health, and identify potential threats. This data is crucial for the formulation of conservation strategies.</p></li><li><p>Targeted Management: Different orchid cultivars may have unique needs and vulnerabilities. Knowledge of the exact type of orchid allows for targeted conservation efforts, such as customized habitat restoration or breeding programs.</p></li></ul><p>Drawing on data from the National Cymbidium faberi Germplasm and Cymbidium Resource Center at the Hunan Horticultural Research Institute, I created the Orchids2024 dataset, boasting over 150,000 images and encompassing over 1,200 cultivars of Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids. With this data, I developed an image classification system for identifying and classifying these cultivars, which can be used by researchers, orchid growers, and enthusiasts to enhance conservation efforts and cultivar development.</p><p>The cultivar resource image datasets and image classification systems of Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids are transforming germplasm resource centers, empowering researchers and breeders to unlock the full potential of plant diversity. These tools go beyond simply storing physical samples; they provide a powerful lens to deep-dive into cultivar characteristics, optimize germplasm management, and ultimately accelerate the development of sustainable crops for the future.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="footnote1" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://globalorchidtrade.wixsite.com/home/post/2020/03/18/orchids-culture-markets-a-brief-history-of-chinas-wild-cymbidium-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orchids, Culture &amp; Markets. globalorchidtrade.wixsite.com/home/post/2020/03/18/orchids-culture-markets-a-brief-history-of-chinas-wild-cymbidium-trade.
