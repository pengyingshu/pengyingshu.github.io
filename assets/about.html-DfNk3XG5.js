My research has streamlined the cultivation management process for plants and elevated the quality of related decisions. During my research career, I’ve delved deep into the germination physiology and cultivation techniques of forestry tree seeds, and enthusiastically ventured into the collection and evaluation of horticultural plant germplasm resources. But that’s not all! I’ve also conducted omics research on seed germination and participated in research fields such as forest fire monitoring and pest identification. My research covers a wide range of subjects, including trees, fruit trees, flowers, and more, with the aim of achieving cross-disciplinary knowledge integration and application to propel the research and application of intelligent cultivation technology in agriculture.
