The objective of such research would be to integrate artificial intelligence with traditional horticultural practices to establish optimal growth conditions for these orchids through efficient and precise analysis, ultimately enhancing management and decision-making processes. These advancements are poised to revolutionize orchid cultivation, and promote more sustainable and efficient orchid production, which will significantly benefit producers and consumers alike.</p><p>Our goal is to fill this gap by conducting in-depth research in this area. To achieve this goal, we are actively researching large-scale image classification of Chinese Cymbidium cultivars, with a particular emphasis on dataset construction and establishing classification models. As part of our efforts, we have successfully created the Orchid 2024 dataset and made it available, along with relevant source code. Our comprehensive orchid image dataset and classification system can serve as a valuable tool for the management of orchid germplasm resources, providing researchers in the fields of horticulture and botany with a valuable resource for the study of orchid morphology, physiology, and ecology, and facilitating the identification, cultivation, preservation, and marketing of orchids. Additionally, we have conducted extensive research on the identification of diseases and pests affecting orchids.</p><p>Looking ahead, with the help of artificial intelligence, I aspire to make strides in our understanding of orchids and their cultivation techniques. I hope that our efforts will generate valuable insights into bridging the gap between scientific research and practical applications, and make meaningful contributions to this important research field.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="footnote1" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/177/2/151/2416341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase, Mark W., et al. &quot;An updated classification of Orchidaceae.&quot; Botanical journal of the Linnean Society 177.2 (2015): 151-174.</a> <a href="#footnote-ref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="footnote2" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468265921000792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhou, Zhihua, et al. &quot;Orchid conservation in China from 2000 to 2020: Achievements and perspectives.&quot; Plant Diversity 43.5 (2021): 343-349.</a> <a href="#footnote-ref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="footnote3" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(05)00192-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cozzolino, Salvatore, and Alex Widmer. &quot;Orchid diversity: an evolutionary consequence of deception?.&quot; Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20.9 (2005): 487-494.</a> <a href="#footnote-ref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="footnote4" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13580-018-0010-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ning, Huijuan, et al. &quot;Correlation analysis between the karyotypes and phenotypic traits of Chinese cymbidium cultivars.&quot; Horticulture, Environment, and Biotechnology 59 (2018): 93-103.</a> <a href="#footnote-ref4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="footnote5" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0367326X1000242X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hossain, Mohammad Musharof. &quot;Therapeutic orchids: traditional uses and recent advances—an overview.&quot; Fitoterapia 82.2 (2011): 102-140.</a> <a href="#footnote-ref5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="footnote6" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/13056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hew, Choy Sin, and Yik Suan Wong.
