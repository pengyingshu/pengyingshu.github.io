A strong fan to circulate the greenhouse air is also beneficial. Plants standing outside will be well ventilated.</p><p>A lot of Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> cannot grow outdoors all year long. You will need to transplant them indoors in winter, as even the slightest frost can kill your Chinese Cymbidium.

Use a sterile knife to separate divisions with at least 3 bulbs each.</li><li>Choose a container deep enough for long roots, but not oversized. Avoid overpotting.</li><li>For Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchids , use tree fern fiber if available, or fir bark as an alternative. Repot every 2 years in spring after flowering. When repotting, make sure that the roots stay intact or else you would not see them bloom for a year or two. Some growers even wait two to three years before attempting such a task.</li><li>Water moderately after repotting, keeping the mix moist without saturating. Provide shade until new growth appears.</li></ul><p><strong>Harvesting flowers</strong></p><p>To showcase the elegant blooms of your Chinese <em>Cymbidium</em> orchid in a vase, select stems with only 2-3 open flowers. Make a diagonal cut at the base of the stem and immediately place it in a clean vase. Your cut orchid will grace your space for up to 14 days, or even longer with the help of flower preservatives.</p><p><strong>Transplanting flowers</strong></p><ul><li>Timing: Late spring to early autumn (growing season)</li><li>Location: Well-lit, well-drained, cool and moist (but not overwatered)</li><li>Spacing: 1-2 feet apart (30-60 cm) for individual flourishing</li><li>Transplanting Steps: <ul><li>Preparation: Gather &amp; clean tools.</li><li>Hole: Dig a deep hole twice the width of the root ball.</li><li>Placement: Gently place plant at original depth.</li><li>Backfilling: Fill hole, gently firming around the base.</li><li>Watering: Water thoroughly after planting.</li><li>Attention: Before transplanting, the roots of orchids should be disinfected.
